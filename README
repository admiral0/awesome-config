You should adapt scripts to your hardware

TODO:
 * Battery meter (pure lua implementation)
 * Better tag management. (Idea: use shifty and name each tag after its program, then replace wibox with menu)
 * Popup XMMS2
 * Popup `screen` launcher
 * Hardware status wibar
 * separate HW related functions in separate file
